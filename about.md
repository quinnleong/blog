My name is Quinn (梁青昆).

I'm a mixed non-binary tongzhi (同志), via chinese-malaysian family.
I think often of masculinity/femininity, queerness, "home", relationships, and boundaries.

I like to make [music][music] / take [photos][photos] /
write [poems][poems] & [essays](essays) / make
[things on the internet][things].

I love being an introvert, and a virgo, and can usually be found in Oakland, CA.
