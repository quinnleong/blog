Hey! üëãüèº My name is Quinn Leong (Ê¢ÅÈùíÊòÜ). I'm a software engineer and artist.

I've spent the last couple of years working on the engineering team at [Checkr][checkr], focusing on
product monetization, billing, and payments. Before that I
designed & built a web application for a local meal program for elders & other community members,
taught future software engineers, and worked on data insights at the San Francisco MTA (aka Muni).

My perspectives are undoubtedly framed by my experiences being mixed-race,
transgender, part of the Chinese-Malaysia diaspora, and brought up in a lot of different
places, from Knoxville, Tennessee to Singapore and many in between.
I care a lot about building strong relationships and inclusive teams.

In engineering work, I value thoughtfulness, open communication, learning & growth,
adaptability, agility, and collaboration.

In art & life, I think often of masculinity/femininity, queerness, "home", cultural legacies & practices, relationships, and boundaries.

I like to [make][makzai-music] [music][ql-music] / take [photos][photos] /
write [poems][poems] & [essays][essays] / make
[things on the internet][things].

I love being an introvert, and a virgo, and can usually be found in Oakland, CA.
