Spot on, incisive memoir of diving into the tech industry in SF with no
idea of the absurdity awaiting her.

Says it all dead-pan narrator style, and this hits harder than any outright critique would.

Deeply comical and horrifying in equal measures.

Would recommend to those interested in the cultural aspects of the tech industry,
hoping to both laugh and cringe, or simply looking for a solid memoir.
